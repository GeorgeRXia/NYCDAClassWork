css reset to get past browser's stylings- normalize.css(website).
above the css href for the html then link it to the normalize.css style sheet. default browser 

Cascading:
for priority cascading style sheets is the more bottom has prioity. then their is horizontal prioity where a more specific class selector gets prioity. 
	div{} is less prioity than  div a{}

and horizontal that is more specific takes presedence than more bottom one. horizontal > more bottom. if it is equal specificity then the lower one takes presedence. 


also the bottom will inherit in parent child relationship. but can be over ruled by a lower level (more inner bracket) so it does not apply. 

However for the list style the upper (<ul>) can be overruled by the lower level <li>

A style tag ( <style= "font-size: 12px;")- do not use it. however it takes presedences over everything. color: black; !important; this overrides everything and that forces it do it.

****Even though !important; was on the top div it wouldn't effect the <p> within that <dev>****
